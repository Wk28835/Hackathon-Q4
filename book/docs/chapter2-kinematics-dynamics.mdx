This chapter delves into the mathematical foundations of robot motion, specifically kinematics and dynamics, which are crucial for understanding how robots move and interact with their environment.

## Robot Kinematics
Kinematics describes the motion of robots without considering the forces and torques that cause the motion.

### Forward Kinematics
Calculates the position and orientation of the end-effector given the joint angles.

```python
def forward_kinematics(joint_angles):
    # Implementation details for calculating end-effector pose
    pass
```

### Inverse Kinematics
Calculates the joint angles required to achieve a desired end-effector position and orientation.

## Robot Dynamics
Dynamics deals with the relationship between the forces and torques applied to a robot and the resulting motion.

### Equations of Motion
Typically derived using methods like Lagrange's equations or Newton-Euler formulation.

M(q)q̈ + C(q,q̇)q̇ + G(q) = τ
```
Where:
*   `M(q)`: Mass matrix
*   `C(q,q̇)`: Coriolis and centrifugal forces
*   `G(q)`: Gravity forces
*   `τ`: Joint torques
