Perception is vital for autonomous robots to understand their surroundings. This chapter explores various sensors and perception algorithms used in humanoid robotics.

## Types of Sensors
Humanoid robots utilize a range of sensors to gather information about their internal state and the external environment.

### Proprioceptive Sensors
*   **Encoders:** Measure joint positions and velocities.
*   **IMUs (Inertial Measurement Units):** Provide orientation, angular velocity, and linear acceleration.
*   **Force/Torque Sensors:** Measure interaction forces at joints or end-effectors.

### Exteroceptive Sensors
*   **Cameras (Monocular, Stereo, RGB-D):** Capture visual information for object recognition, mapping, and tracking.
*   **Lidars:** Provide precise depth information by emitting laser pulses.
*   **Microphones:** Detect sound for speech recognition and sound localization.

## Perception Algorithms
Processing sensor data to build a meaningful representation of the world.

### Computer Vision
*   Object Detection and Recognition
*   Semantic Segmentation
*   Visual Odometry and SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping)

### Sensor Fusion
Combining data from multiple sensors to obtain a more robust and accurate understanding of the environment.
