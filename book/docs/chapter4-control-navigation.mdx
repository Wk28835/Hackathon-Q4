This chapter focuses on the control strategies that enable humanoid robots to execute desired movements and navigate complex environments effectively and safely.

## Robot Control Architectures
Different approaches to controlling robot motion.

### Joint-Space Control
Directly controls each joint to achieve desired angles or torques.

### Task-Space Control
Controls the end-effector's position and orientation in Cartesian space.

```cpp
// Example: PID controller for a joint
double calculate_pid_output(double setpoint, double current_value, double dt) {
    // PID logic
    return output;
}
```

## Locomotion and Balance
Specific challenges in controlling legged robots.

### Walking Gaits
*   Static walking
*   Dynamic walking

### Balance Control
Maintaining stability using concepts like Zero Moment Point (ZMP) and Center of Pressure (CoP).

## Navigation
Enabling robots to move from one point to another while avoiding obstacles.

### Path Planning
Generating optimal or feasible paths from start to goal.

### Obstacle Avoidance
Reactive and planned strategies to prevent collisions.
