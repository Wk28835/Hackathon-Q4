Welcome to the "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics" course! This chapter introduces the fundamental concepts of Physical AI and provides an overview of humanoid robotics.

## What is Physical AI?
Physical AI refers to intelligent systems that interact with the physical world through perception, decision-making, and action. It combines aspects of artificial intelligence, robotics, and control theory.

### Key Components
*   **Perception:** Gathering information from the environment (e.g., cameras, sensors).
*   **Reasoning:** Processing information and making decisions.
*   **Action:** Executing physical movements (e.g., robotic arms, locomotion).

## Humanoid Robotics
Humanoid robots are robots designed to resemble the human body, often with a torso, head, two arms, and two legs. They are developed for various purposes, including research, assistance, and exploration.

### Applications
*   Disaster response
*   Healthcare and elder care
*   Manufacturing and assembly
*   Space exploration

## Course Outline
This course will cover:
1.  Robot Kinematics and Dynamics
2.  Sensing and Perception
3.  Robot Control and Navigation
